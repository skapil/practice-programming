"""
Given an infinite supply of ‘n’ coin denominations and a total money amount,
we are asked to find the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount.

Example 1:
    Denominations: {1,2,3}
        Total amount: 5
        Output: 2
    Explanation: We need minimum of two coins {2,3} to make a total of '5'
    Example 2:
        Denominations: {1,2,3}
        Total amount: 11
        Output: 4
Explanation: We need minimum four coins {2,3,3,3} to make a total of '11'
